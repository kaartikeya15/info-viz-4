    <p>Color Scale Explanation: Each country’s color represents its CO₂ emissions relative to its own historical emissions, not compared to other countries. This allows you to observe trends and changes within individual countries over time. A country turning darker indicates an increase compared to its past emissions, even if its total emissions are lower than those of other countries.</p>
